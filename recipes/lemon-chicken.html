    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the
        flour in a shallow bowl. Season the chicken breasts with salt, then
        gently press into the flour to coat; shake off the excess flour. Arrange
        the chicken in the skillet. Cook until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes on
        each side. Add the white wine and lemon juice. Continue cooking until
        the chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the cooking
        liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 7 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to
        a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the skillet from heat, and stir butter into the sauce until
        melted. Pour sauce over the chicken breasts, and garnish with capers and
        lemon wedges.
