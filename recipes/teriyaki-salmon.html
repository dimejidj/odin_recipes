    <p>
      Salmon is a favorite of my husband. This recipe never fails to be a hit,
      whether we broil the salmon in the oven or grill it outdoors. Pair it with
      some homemade teriyaki fried rice to complete your meal.

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>oil</li>
      <li>soy sauce</li>
      <li>salmon steaks</li>
      <li>garlic</li>
      <li>lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps to make the food</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds,
        ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low
        heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside
        1/2 cup of marinade for basting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag and place salmon
        into the marinade. Squeeze air out of the bag, seal, and marinate the
        salmon steaks for at least 1 hour (2 hours for better flavor). Drain and
        discard used marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set oven rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's
        broiler. Place salmon steaks into a broiler pan and broil for 5 minutes.
        Brush steaks with reserved marinade, turn, and broil until fish is
        opaque and flakes easily, about 5 more minutes. Brush again with
        marinade.
